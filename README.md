# igem-wiki-template

This repo is an starter template for igem wiki with flask backend.

## Structure

- `public`: output static site to be deployed

- `wiki`: where to put all the pages

- `static`: where to put js/css dependencies.
  
  - `index.md`: I have included some useful libraries. Check this file for details and use tips!

- `app.py`: run and build the static flask app; It is recommended to use the `url_for()`

method in flask for routing, which better integrates with `frozen_flask`
